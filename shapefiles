# Define Grand Bahama Terrestrial Area using Shapefile --------------------
#A Shapefile polygon outlining the Grand Bahama Contiguous terrestrial area was created using ArcGIS 10.5 by Ancilleno Davis
# The file has the following characteristics

# Shapefile:	C:\Users\davisao2\Desktop\ArcGIS map data\My maps\layer packages\Grand_Bahama_Outline.shp
# Geometry Type:	Polygon
# Coordinates have Z values:	No 
# Coordinates have measures:	No 
# 
# Projected Coordinate System:	WGS_1984_Web_Mercator_Auxiliary_Sphere
# Projection:	Mercator_Auxiliary_Sphere
# False_Easting:	0.00000000
# False_Northing:	0.00000000
# Central_Meridian:	0.00000000
# Standard_Parallel_1:	0.00000000
# Auxiliary_Sphere_Type:	0.00000000
# Linear Unit: 	Meter
# 
# Geographic Coordinate System:	GCS_WGS_1984
# Datum: 	D_WGS_1984
# Prime Meridian: 	Greenwich
